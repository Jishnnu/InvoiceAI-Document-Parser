**InvoiceAI** is a proof-of-concept project aimed to parse the invoice data from images and return the resultant data in a JSON format. This repository contains a `Jupyter Notebook (Invoice_AI.ipynb)` file that discusses multiple approaches that can be used to achieve the project's objective and a `streamlit_app.py` file that implements a simple _Streamlit Application_ with Mindee's OCR API.
